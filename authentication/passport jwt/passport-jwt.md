# **Passport-JWT Authentication**

## **Beginnerâ€™s Guide**

Passport.js with **JWT (JSON Web Token)** lets users log in without the server storing their session.  
Instead, the user carries a **token** â€” like a digital ID â€” and presents it whenever they interact with the server.

### **How it Works**

1. **Login** â†’ User submits username & password.  
2. **Verification** â†’ Server checks credentials.  
3. **Token Creation** â†’ Server generates a **JWT**, signed with a secret key.  
4. **Token Storage** â†’ User keeps the JWT (localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookie).  
5. **Requests** â†’ User sends the JWT with every request.  
6. **Validation** â†’ Server checks the token â†’ grants access if valid & not expired.

### **Why Use JWT?**

- Stateless â†’ No server-side session storage.  
- Perfect for APIs, mobile apps, and microservices.  
- Secure, as long as you **keep your token safe**.

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Always set **expiry times** for JWTs and implement **refresh tokens** to maintain security and reduce frequent logins.
