## **Passport JWT Authentication**


## **Passport JWT Authentication â€“ Beginner Version**

A way to log users in using **Passport.js** and **JWT (JSON Web Token)**, where the server doesnâ€™t have to remember anything about you â€” instead, you carry your proof (the token) with you.

---

### **What it is**

When you log in, the server gives you a **token** (like a digital ID card) that proves who you are. You keep it, and you show it every time you talk to the server.

---

### **How it works (simple steps)**

1. **You log in** â†’ The server checks your username & password.
2. If correct â†’ The server makes a **JWT** (a small text file with your info, locked with a secret key).
3. The server gives the JWT to you â†’ You keep it (in your browser storage or cookie).
4. Next time you ask the server for something â†’ You send the JWT along.
5. The server checks the JWT â†’ If itâ€™s real & not expired â†’ You get access.

### **Why use it?**

* No need for the server to store your session data.
* Works great for APIs, mobile apps, and microservices.
* You just need to protect your token (donâ€™t share it).

ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tip:** Always set an **expiry time** for JWTs and use **refresh tokens** to avoid logging in again too often.
